# Fake News Detection Project

The project aims to develop a machine-learning model capable of identifying and classifying any news article as fake. The distribution of fake news can potentially have highly adverse effects on people and culture. This project involves building and training a model to classify news as fake or not using a diverse dataset of news articles. We have used four techniques to determine the model's results.

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boost Classifier**
4. **Random Forest Classifier**

## Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, where information spreads rapidly through various online platforms. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to automatically determine the authenticity of news articles, providing a valuable tool to combat misinformation.

## Dataset

We have used a labelled dataset containing news articles and corresponding labels (true or false). The dataset is divided into two classes:
- True: Genuine news articles
- False: Fake or fabricated news articles

## Results

We evaluated each classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are documented in the project files.
